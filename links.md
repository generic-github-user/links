into machine learning originally

### tools

- https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning
- https://colab.research.google.com/ - Jupyter-like notebook environment for
ML and data science experimentation; has fairly decent hardware available
for "free" (go to `Runtime > Change runtime type` and set to GPU or TPU;
works best with larger datasets and batch sizes)

## etc

Things I haven't read or used yet but consistently hear good reviews of (or
have other reason to think highly of). I do intend to get to most of these
eventually and will update this list accordingly.
