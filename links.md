## software

### text editors

- https://github.com/atom/atom - a decent text editor if you like CSS a little too much, have at least 16GB of RAM, and are scared of vim
		- packages
				- https://atom.io/packages/latex
				- https://atom.io/packages/atom-clock
				- https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify
				- https://atom.io/packages/minimap

- vim
		- https://github.com/neovim/neovim - my main text editor; extremely efficient
		and fairly simple to augment with hundreds of tools developed by obscenely
		smart people over the last 30 years
		- https://vimcolorschemes.com/ - eye candy to hold you over until the
		next PR is finished (work in neovim too)
		- https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug - least painful option for
		installing and updating vim/neovim plugins
		- learning
				- "grok[king] vi"
						- https://irian.to/blogs/mastering-vim-grammar/
						- https://stackoverflow.com/a/1220118
				- https://www.openvim.com/
				- https://vim.rtorr.com/
		- https://vimawesome.com/
		- https://github.com/akrawchyk/awesome-vim

- https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ - for nostalgia (also a reasonable
choice for those who are staunchly opposed to using a command-line
editor but don't have unlimited RAM to run Atom or VS Code)

- https://code.visualstudio.com/ - a good first approximation if you ever
find yourself in the unenviable position of having to write Java code

### diagramming

- https://app.diagrams.net/ (draw.io)

### document conversion

- https://github.com/jgm/pandoc

### web browsers

- https://vivaldi.com/ - elegant Chromium-based browser with more
features for power users
- https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/
- https://www.torproject.org/ - for the truly paranoid
		
### media and animation

- https://www.blender.org/ - quite literally the best free software I've ever used
- https://github.com/3b1b/manim

### terminal emulators

- https://konsole.kde.org/ - built into KDE and generally pleasant to
use; plays nicely with [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
ligatures
- https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/ - a stable and *very* well-optimized
TE; includes enough shortcuts out of the box to be a decent standalone
tmux replacement[^1]

		- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13342516

### productivity

- https://todoist.com/ - one of the better todo managers I've worked with
(was actually my daily driver for almost two years); great for a
multi-device workflow

### command-line/shell

- search
		- https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep
		- https://github.com/sharkdp/fd
- zsh
		- https://ohmyz.sh/

into machine learning originally

### organizations

### tools

- https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning
- https://colab.research.google.com/ - Jupyter-like notebook environment for
ML and data science experimentation; has fairly decent hardware available
for "free" (go to `Runtime > Change runtime type` and set to GPU or TPU;
works best with larger datasets and batch sizes)
