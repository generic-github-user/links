## Software

### Text editors

- https://github.com/atom/atom - a decent text editor if you like CSS a little too much, have at least 16GB of RAM, and are scared of vim
    - packages
        - https://atom.io/packages/latex
        - https://atom.io/packages/atom-clock
        - https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify
        - https://atom.io/packages/minimap

- vim
    - https://github.com/neovim/neovim - my main text editor; extremely efficient
    and fairly simple to augment with hundreds of tools developed by obscenely
    smart people over the last 30 years
    - https://vimcolorschemes.com/ - eye candy to hold you over until the
    next PR is finished (work in neovim too)
    - https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug - least painful option for
    installing and updating vim/neovim plugins
    - learning
        - "grok[king] vi"
            - https://irian.to/blogs/mastering-vim-grammar/
            - https://stackoverflow.com/a/1220118
        - https://www.openvim.com/
        - https://vim.rtorr.com/
    - https://vimawesome.com/
    - https://github.com/akrawchyk/awesome-vim

- https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ - for nostalgia (also a reasonable
choice for those who are staunchly opposed to using a command-line
editor but don't have unlimited RAM to run Atom or VS Code)

- https://code.visualstudio.com/ - a good first approximation if you ever
find yourself in the unenviable position of having to write Java code

### Diagramming

- https://app.diagrams.net/ (draw.io)

### Document conversion

- https://github.com/jgm/pandoc

### Web browsers

- https://vivaldi.com/ - elegant Chromium-based browser with more
features for power users
- https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/
- https://www.torproject.org/ - for the truly paranoid
    
### Media and animation

- https://www.blender.org/ - quite literally the best free software I've ever used
- https://github.com/3b1b/manim

### Terminal emulators

- https://konsole.kde.org/ - built into KDE and generally pleasant to
use; plays nicely with [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
ligatures
- https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/ - a stable and *very* well-optimized
TE; includes enough shortcuts out of the box to be a decent standalone
tmux replacement[^1]

works best with larger datasets and batch sizes)
